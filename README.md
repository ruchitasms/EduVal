### 🎯 The Mission
EduVal is an interactive learning platform designed to translate complex financial data into intuitive insights. Most retail investors look at price; data professionals look at the "engine" behind the price. This project is a work-in-progress journey to bridge the gap between Financial Literacy and Data Science, helping users see the "truth" behind the tickers.

### 📊 Core Framework (Current Features)
Phase 1: The Valuation Verdict Engine
Contextual Multiples: Automatically categorizes stocks into Value Plays, Fair Value, or Premium Growth based on their live EV/EBITDA multiples.
Sector-Specific Intelligence: The UI dynamically adjusts its theme and logic (e.g., Energy vs. Software) to reflect different market expectations.
Momentum Tracking: Real-time 7-day price visualization using Chart.js to compare market sentiment against fundamental value.

Phase 2: Financial Statement Deep Dive (New!)
The "Report Card" View: A dedicated dashboard for the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow.
Automated Logic Badges: * Liquidity (Healthy vs. Risk): Checks if Current Assets can cover immediate liabilities.
Efficiency (High Moat vs. Standard): Identifies companies with pricing power through high Net Margins.
Quality (High Quality vs. Accrual Warning): Validates if reported profits are backed by actual Free Cash Flow.
Bridge Metrics: Integrated EBITDA and Enterprise Value directly into the statement views to show the link between a company’s operations and its market price.

### ⛏️ Built With
API: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) Stable API.
Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Pico.css Framework), JavaScript (Vanilla).
Visualization: Chart.js for real-time market momentum.
Logic: Custom-built financial screening algorithms.

#### 🏢 Constraints
Since this project uses a free API tier, our study is currently focused on a curated list of 10 high-impact companies across diverse sectors (Tech, Energy, Fintech, etc.) to ensure data accuracy and speed.

### ⏭️ Next-up: Phase 3
Risk & Leverage Metrics - the part of finance that reveals how companies react under pressure.
Dividend Sustainability: Checking if the "Profit" is actually reaching the shareholders.
