### 🎯 The Mission
EduVal is an interactive learning platform designed to translate complex financial data into intuitive insights. Most retail investors look at price; data professionals look at the "engine" behind the price. This project is a work-in-progress journey to connect Financial Literacy with Data Science.

### 📊 Core Framework (Current Features)
- The Valuation Verdict Engine: Automatically categorizes stocks into Value Plays, Fair Value, or Premium Growth based on their $EV/EBITDA$ multiples.
- Sector-Specific Intelligence: The UI dynamically adjusts its theme (colors and logic) based on the industry (Energy, Tech, Entertainment, Semiconductors etc) to reflect different market expectations.
- The Learning Hub: A built-in, collapsible glossary that explains the practical "Real-World" application of metrics like Net Debt/EBITDA.

### ⛏️ Built With
- API: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) Stable API.
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS (Pico.css Framework), JavaScript.
- Visualization: Chart.js for real-time market momentum tracking.

 ### 🏢 Constraints
 Since this project uses a free api, we're kepping our study narrowed down to 10 publicly traded companies across different sectors.
